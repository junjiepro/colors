# Story 1.2: MCP Tool Debugging Interface

## Status

- [x] Draft
- [x] Approved
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Done

## Story

**As a** developer using Colors,
**I want to** debug MCP tool interactions in real-time,
**so that** I can quickly identify and resolve any issues with my MCP tool configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can access the debugging interface by clicking on a connected MCP tool
2. Interface shows real-time logs of all interactions with the selected MCP tool
3. Logs include:
   - Timestamp of each interaction
   - Request/response data (collapsible for readability)
   - Status codes and error messages
   - Performance metrics (response time, payload size)
4. Interactive console allows sending test requests with:
   - Method selection (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
   - URL/endpoint input
   - Request headers editor
   - Request body editor (with JSON validation)
   - Send button with loading state
5. Response viewer shows:
   - Status code and status text
   - Response headers
   - Formatted response body (JSON/XML/plain text)
   - Response time
6. Ability to clear logs and save session history
7. Search and filter functionality for logs
8. Visual indicators for different message types (info, success, warning, error)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design and implement the debugging interface layout
- [ ] Create real-time log viewer component
- [ ] Implement interactive console for test requests
- [ ] Add request/response visualization
- [ ] Implement log filtering and search
- [ ] Add performance metrics display
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
- [ ] Add documentation for debugging features

## Dev Notes

- Use WebSockets for real-time log streaming
- Consider using Monaco Editor for code editing in the console
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use virtualization for log rendering to handle large volumes
- Follow the design system from the UI specification
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Test log parsing and formatting
- Test request/response handling
- Test filter and search functionality

### Integration Tests

- Test real-time log streaming
- Test console request/response cycle
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

### Manual Tests

- Verify real-time updates work as expected
- Test with different MCP tool types
- Verify error handling and user feedback
- Test performance with large log volumes
