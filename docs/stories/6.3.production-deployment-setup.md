## Story

**As** the operations team,
**I want to** have a reliable and automated deployment pipeline,
**so that** we can deploy new versions of the Colors application to production with confidence and minimal downtime.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated build and test process
   - Staging environment that mirrors production
   - One-click deployment to production
   - Rollback capability

2. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Terraform configurations for all cloud resources
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Secrets management
   - Network topology documentation

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Application performance monitoring
   - Error tracking and logging
   - System health dashboards
   - Alert thresholds and notifications

4. **Security**
   - Automated security scanning
   - Dependabot for dependency updates
   - Secrets rotation
   - Compliance documentation

## Technical Requirements

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform + AWS/Azure/GCP
- **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack or similar
- **Security**: OWASP ZAP, Snyk

## Dependencies

- Story 6.1: Web Dashboard Implementation
- Story 6.2: Responsive Design Optimization

## Out of Scope

- Multi-region deployment
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Load testing at scale

## Open Questions

1. Which cloud provider will we use for production?
2. What's our deployment strategy (blue-green, canary, rolling)?
3. What are our RTO and RPO requirements?

## Story Points: 8

## Priority: High

## Test Scenarios

1. Verify deployment to staging environment
2. Test rollback procedure
3. Validate monitoring setup
4. Security scan results review
5. Performance testing

## Documentation

- Deployment runbook
- Incident response procedures
- Infrastructure diagrams
- Recovery point and recovery time objectives
