## Status

- [x] Draft
- [x] Approved
- [x] In Progress
- [x] Review
- [x] Done

## Story

**As a** developer using Colors,
**I want to** connect and configure MCP tools through a user-friendly interface,
**so that** I can quickly set up my development environment and start using AI capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can access the MCP Tools section from the main navigation
2. Interface displays a list of currently connected MCP tools with status indicators
3. "Add Tool" button opens a form to configure a new MCP tool connection
4. Configuration form includes fields for:
   - Tool name (required)
   - Connection type (StreamableHTTP/STDIO)
   - Endpoint URL or command
   - Authentication method (none/basic/token/API key)
   - Test connection button
5. Successful connection shows a confirmation message and adds the tool to the list
6. Failed connection shows clear error messages with troubleshooting steps
7. Each tool in the list shows:
   - Name
   - Connection status (connected/disconnected/error)
   - Last active timestamp
   - Quick actions (test, edit, delete)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create MCP Tools list component
- [ ] Design and implement Add/Edit tool form
- [ ] Implement connection testing functionality
- [ ] Add status indicators and tooltips
- [ ] Write unit tests for connection logic
- [ ] Implement error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add documentation for MCP tool setup

## Dev Notes

- Use React Hook Form for form handling
- Implement connection testing with proper timeouts
- Consider using WebSockets for real-time status updates
- Store tool configurations in the local database with encryption for sensitive data
- Follow the design system from the UI specification

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Test form validation
- Test connection success/failure states
- Test error handling

### Integration Tests

- Test tool addition/removal flow
- Test connection status updates
- Test error scenarios

### Manual Tests

- Verify UI matches the design spec
- Test with different MCP tool types
- Verify error messages are helpful
