- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Done

## Story

**As a** developer using Colors,
**I want to** perform bulk operations on multiple MCP tools,
**so that** I can efficiently manage many tools at once.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Bulk Selection**
   - Checkbox selection for each tool in the list
   - "Select All" toggle in the table header
   - Selected items counter in the action bar
   - Visual indication of selected rows

2. **Bulk Actions**
   - Connect/Disconnect selected tools
   - Delete multiple tools with confirmation
   - Export/Import tool configurations
   - Apply tags to multiple tools

3. **Bulk Status Updates**
   - Real-time status updates for bulk operations
   - Progress indicator for long-running operations
   - Summary of results after completion
   - Detailed error reporting for failed operations

4. **Performance**
   - Smooth UI with 50+ selected tools
   - Background processing for bulk operations
   - Cancellation support for in-progress operations

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement bulk selection UI components
- [ ] Create bulk action buttons and menus
- [ ] Develop bulk operation handlers
- [ ] Add progress and status indicators
- [ ] Implement error handling and reporting
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
- [ ] Add documentation for bulk operations

## Technical Notes

- Use React's Context API for selection state
- Implement Web Workers for background processing
- Add optimistic UI updates for better responsiveness
- Follow WCAG 2.1 for keyboard navigation
- Include loading states and skeleton loaders
