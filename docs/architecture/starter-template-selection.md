# **Starter Template Selection**

**Decision**: Build from scratch with modern tooling rather than using existing templates to maintain full control over MCP integration and CLI tool requirements.

**Rationale**:

- MCP integration requires custom tooling not covered by existing templates
- CLI tool needs specific Deno compilation requirements
- Custom monorepo structure optimized for our specific use case
