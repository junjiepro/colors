# **Goals and Background Context**

**Primary Goal**: Create an AI-powered platform that democratizes access to AI tools by providing a unified interface for MCP management, AI API routing, and agent-driven application creation.

**Background**: The AI tooling landscape is fragmented, with MCP tools requiring technical expertise and no centralized way to share AI-powered solutions. Colors bridges this gap by creating a platform where developers can build and share AI applications, while non-technical users can leverage these capabilities through simple conversations.

**Success Metrics**:

- Developers can connect and debug 3+ MCP tools within 5 minutes
- Non-technical users can create AI-powered applications via conversation
- Application sharing is frictionless with public links
- CLI tool runs via `npx colors` without global installation
